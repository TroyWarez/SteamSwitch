This looks excellent. You have successfully removed the duplicate sections, fixed the grammar issues, and the structure is now logical and easy to follow.

I only found **one small typo** in the Audio Device Switching section:
*   **Current text:** "...exact name of your **perfered** desktop output device..."
*   **Correction:** "...exact name of your **preferred** desktop output device..."

Here is the corrected block for that specific section so you can copy-paste it:

### 2. Audio Device Switching
To enable automatic audio switching between your Couch (TV) and Desk setup:

1.  **Navigate to:** `%USERPROFILE%\Steam Switch\`
2.  **Create Files:** Create the following three text files:
    *   `BPAudioDevice.txt`
    *   `DESKAudioDevice.txt`
    *   `LastBPAudioDevice.txt`
3.  **Define TV Audio:** Open `BPAudioDevice.txt` and paste the exact name of your TV/Couch output device (e.g., `SAMSUNG (NVIDIA High Definition Audio)`).
4.  **Define Desk Audio:** Open `DESKAudioDevice.txt` and paste the exact name of your preferred desktop output device (e.g., `Speakers (3-Dell AC511 USB SoundBar)`).
5.  **Initialize Cache:** Open `LastBPAudioDevice.txt` and paste the **Desktop** output device name (same as step 4).

*Tip: You can find the exact device names in the Windows Sound Settings.*

### Overall Verdict
Once you fix that spelling error, this `README.md` is **ready to publish**. It is professional, the formatting (bolding/code blocks) helps the user scan the text quickly, and the instructions are precise. Great job cleaning it up!
